            Both around the world and in the United States, women have made incredible steps towards equity in the workplace in the past century. However, inequality between men and women remains persistent, with factors such as education, familial expectations and ingrained sexism in society prohibiting women from achieving full equality. 
            The goal of our project is to display existing inequalities to make them clearer, both in the United States and around the world.

            The following world map shows the 16+ year-old labor force participation female to male ratio in the year 2021.
            Overall, women still has less labor participation than men in all most every country.
            Female labor participation rate is over 50% and male labor participation rate is over 65%. Women's
            participation is lowest in the Middle East countries, such as Iraq, Iran, etc, with only 10% - 20% participation
            rate. Women are discouraged from working due to culture and religion reasons in such area.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the contrary, women's participation is relatively high in the poorest and most well-developed countries.
            In agriculture dominant country, women are more likely to participate in small-holder agricultural work [1],
            so the labor participation rate is relatively high.
            In developed countries, women have more opportunities and are more encouraged to pursue the same work opportunities as men,
            but men still lead by around 10% participation.

        </div>
        <br>
        <p> According to the National Science Foundation, women are greatly underrepresented in the workforce and only 
            make up 29% of the science and engineering labor force. However, over the past fifty years, women have 
            increasingly participated in the workforce leading to the breakdown of gender roles and the positive evolution 
            of society. The gender gap in STEM is not due to differences in education but the masculine attitudes and cultures 
            that exist in workplaces. Research has shown that external factors like cultures excluding women, persistent 
            stereotypes, and a lack of role models reinforce gender inequities in STEM. Male-dominated culture incorporates 
            unconscious biases such as gender stereotypes with STEM fields being viewed as masculine. These cultures are not 
            supportive of women and minorities. This also results in fewer role models due to limited examples of female 
            scientists and engineers. Additionally, hiring algorithms and automated resume scanners use large datasets that 
            don't equally represent women or minorities. For example, search algorithms show higher paying jobs to men because 
            the underlying data tells the tools that men earn more. If more women enter STEM professions, greater gender equality 
            in society and income are inevitable since these occupations generally have higher wages. An increase in annual fiscal 
            income may improve the socioeconomic status of women globally. Advancements in technology have stimulated the economy 
            by progressing the STEM field and encouraging innovative ideas. Women should have equal access to opportunities in order 
            to ensure individual success and increase background experience. Encouraging women to pursue STEM careers will create a 
            more inclusive workforce.

        <p>The pay gap between men and women continues to plague our nation. 
            Despite having the same skills and putting in the same amount of effort, the work done by women 
            is seen as less valuable and more dispensable. As a result, women are being paid less than their 
            male counterparts across different Jobs, Industries and Education levels. On average, women earn 
            83% of what men earn.  Lesser pay throughout their life leads to lesser retirement savings and 
            decreased financial independence which triggers a series of other societal issues.</p>

        <p>Across all major industries such as Administration, Engineering and Sales, women are paid 
            significantly lesser than men. More specifically, there are some jobs such as Data Scientist
                and Graphic Designer where women are paid marginally more than men. However, 
                in more male dominated jobs such as Software Engineer and IT, men tend to paid much more 
                than women.

        <p>Not only that, unfortunately, women who have earned PHDs earn lesser than men with undergraduate 
            or masters degrees! Thus, the wage gap cannot be explained by the difference in the education 
            of workers. These are stark facts that need to be acted upon with urgency, as at this rate it 
            will take us 90 years to close the wage gap, and we cannot afford to wait this long. Women not 
            only need to be motivated to enter male dominated fields, but also be paid well and equally to 
            ensure gender equity.

        <p> This scatter plot first shows a state-by-state comparison of the percentages of men and women 
            who work part-time. Part-time work is fewer than 35 hours a week, and is often chosen by people 
            who have other responsibilities such as childcare. At the same time, this work comes with minimal 
            benefits or promotions when compared to full-time work such as regular raises, health insurance and 
            paid time off. 
            The plot shows that in every state, a much lower percentage of men than women work part time, 
            perpetuating existing inequalities and stereotypes about women being primary homemakers and caretakers 
            of the family. 
            The color of the scatterplot points is representative of the expected year in which the wage gap 
            closing slightly sooner (closer to 2050 than 2100) when the percentage of women working part time is lower, 
            or when the percentages of men and women working part time is equal.
