            The following world map shows the 16+ year-old labor force participation female to male ratio in the year 2021.
            Overall, women still has less labor participation than men in all most every country.
            Female labor participation rate is over 50% and male labor participation rate is over 65%. Women's
            participation is lowest in the Middle East countries, such as Iraq, Iran, etc, with only 10% - 20% participation
            rate. Women are discouraged from working due to culture and religion reasons in such area.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the contrary, women's participation is relatively high in the poorest and most well-developed countries.
            In agriculture dominant country, women are more likely to participate in small-holder agricultural work [1],
            so the labor participation rate is relatively high.
            In developed countries, women have more opportunities and are more encouraged to pursue the same work opportunities as men,
            but men still lead by around 10% participation.

        <p>The pay gap between men and women continues to plague our nation. 
            Despite having the same skills and putting in the same amount of effort, the work done by women 
            is seen as less valuable and more dispensable. As a result, women are being paid less than their 
            male counterparts across different Jobs, Industries and Education levels. On average, women earn 
            83% of what men earn.  Lesser pay throughout their life leads to lesser retirement savings and 
            decreased financial independence which triggers a series of other societal issues.</p>

        <p>Across all major industries such as Administration, Engineering and Sales, women are paid 
            significantly lesser than men. More specifically, there are some jobs such as Data Scientist
                and Graphic Designer where women are paid marginally more than men. However, 
                in more male dominated jobs such as Software Engineer and IT, men tend to paid much more 
                than women.

        <br>
        <p>Not only that, unfortunately, women who have earned PHDs earn lesser than men with undergraduate 
            or masters degrees! Thus, the wage gap cannot be explained by the difference in the education 
            of workers. These are stark facts that need to be acted upon with urgency, as at this rate it 
            will take us 90 years to close the wage gap, and we cannot afford to wait this long. Women not 
            only need to be motivated to enter male dominated fields, but also be paid well and equally to 
            ensure gender equity.

        <p> This scatter plot first shows a state-by-state comparison of the percentages of men and women 
            who work part-time. Part-time work is fewer than 35 hours a week, and is often chosen by people 
            who have other responsibilities such as childcare. At the same time, this work comes with minimal 
            benefits or promotions when compared to full-time work such as regular raises, health insurance and 
            paid time off. 
            The plot shows that in every state, a much lower percentage of men than women work part time, 
            perpetuating existing inequalities and stereotypes about women being primary homemakers and caretakers 
            of the family. 
            The color of the scatterplot points is representative of the expected year in which the wage gap 
            closing slightly sooner (closer to 2050 than 2100) when the percentage of women working part time is lower, 
            or when the percentages of men and women working part time is equal.
