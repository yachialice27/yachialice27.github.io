        <p>The pay gap between men and women continues to plague our nation. 
            Despite having the same skills and putting in the same amount of effort, the work done by women 
            is seen as less valuable and more dispensable. As a result, women are being paid less than their 
            male counterparts across different Jobs, Industries and Education levels. On average, women earn 
            83% of what men earn.  Lesser pay throughout their life leads to lesser retirement savings and 
            decreased financial independence which triggers a series of other societal issues.</p>

        <p>Across all major industries such as Administration, Engineering and Sales, women are paid 
            significantly lesser than men. More specifically, there are some jobs such as Data Scientist
                and Graphic Designer where women are paid marginally more than men. However, 
                in more male dominated jobs such as Software Engineer and IT, men tend to paid much more 
                than women.

            <div id="dept" class = "container"></div>
            <div id="job_title" class = "container"></div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Not only that, unfortunately, women who have earned PHDs earn lesser than men with undergraduate 
            or masters degrees! Thus, the wage gap cannot be explained by the difference in the education 
            of workers. These are stark facts that need to be acted upon with urgency, as at this rate it 
            will take us 90 years to close the wage gap, and we cannot afford to wait this long. Women not 
            only need to be motivated to enter male dominated fields, but also be paid well and equally to 
            ensure gender equity.
